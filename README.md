# ImSaber.github.io

This site is for my self made indie game company.
It features multiple pages to display the games the company has made and directories to lead the user to the correct pages to download / view the code.

This site will eventually be multipurpose to allow admins to configure whatever components modually without the need to enter code 

Some images on the website are not owned by me, and are either being used as a placeholder or waiting to get a repsonse from the proper owner to determine if I can continue to use the images.
